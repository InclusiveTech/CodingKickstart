## How to run the breakout session

### Goals and non-goals

Goals:
- To make them excited about the possibility of making their own website.
- To show them the tools they can use to teach themselves and make their own website.
- To make sure they leave the session with a clear plan of what to do if they want to start. This includes:
    - Getting them acquainted with the terminology.
    - Having them write their first 5 or 10 lines of HTML in something that they can share.
    - Getting them used to looking into sources (e.g. w3schools) for figuring out how to do something.

Non-goals:
- To teach them to create a webpage

### Structure

By this time, students will already have:

- Been introduced to what HTML and CSS mean.
- Seen someone Hack the News.
- Should have an idea of a topic around which they want to build a website.
- Have set up their environment and written exactly one line of HTML

**Key Points** to mention, in order (we have 45min):

- [25min] Get them started with the tutorial. From here, it's okay if they don't:
    - _You (the instructor) should pick an animal (or other neutral and harmless concept), and progressively build up a codecollab website with the concepts in the tutorial, so that they can see the general flow of building a project._
    - Go to the landing page of W3School's HTML tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp.
        - Copy and paste the example there into the codecollab, and make sure everyone has done so.
        - Change the contents of the tags around a bit to adapt it to the theme you've chosen.
        - Now, what are all these brackets?
    - Go back to the w3schools website, check out the [HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) page.
        - The header has a good explaination for the structure of a tag.
    - Mention that for now we're going to copy them, but they can go back and read more in depth if they want to learn more about why tags are how they are.
    - Go back to the HTML Basic page, and go through the examples for Headings and Paragraphs.
    - Go through the Images section in the same page.
        - It's particularly useful for folks to go through this section, as it tends to be the one that gets students the most excited.
    - If there is time, you can use some of the examples in the [HTML Styles](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp) page to make the website prettier.
- [5min] Teach them to download the codecollab and open it in their computers.
    - Codecollab deletes workspaces after 16 days, so we want to make sure they have some persistence.
- [10min] Next steps:
    - Teach them how to google for concepts they don't understand, this could even be "how to insert a link".
    - Give them some ideas as to what they could add next: Links? Lists? Background colors?
    - If there is extra time, it's good to let them experiment a little bit.

### Considerations
- If possible, enable the red dot on zoom, so that the cursor is easier to track.
- Whenever possible, use right-click-copy and right-click-paste, so that students can see what you're doing.
- Zoom into your browser a bit so that students can see what you're doing.
