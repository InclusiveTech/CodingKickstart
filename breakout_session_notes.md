## How to run the breakout session

### Goals and non-goals

Goals:
- To make them excited about the possibility of making their own website.
- To show them the tools they can use to teach themselves and make their own website.
- To make sure they leave the session with a clear plan of what to do if they want to start. This includes:
    - Setting up some sort of environment.
    - Getting them acquainted with the terminology.
    - Having them write their first 5 or 10 lines of HTML in something that they can share.
    - Starting a tutorial that they can pick back up at their own pace.

Non-goals:
- To teach them to create a webpage

### Structure

By this time, students will already have:

- Been introduced to what HTML and CSS mean.
- Seen someone Hack the News.
- Should have an idea of a topic around which they want to build a website.

**Key Points** to mention, in order (we have 45min):

- [10min] Set up the environment:
    - Have them open the reader notes in [https://inclusivetech.github.io/Inclusive-Tech-Coding-Kickstart/](https://inclusivetech.github.io/Inclusive-Tech-Coding-Kickstart/). Give them a few moments to skim over the structure and make sure they're ready to proceed.
    - Have them open a codecollab.io, in HTML settings. Make sure they all have it open.
    - Have them open the `index.html` file and write anything in it. Make sure this happens.
    - Have them render the webpage and share the links in the chat. Make sure to stop and answer people's questions.
- [20min] Get them started with the tutorial. From here, it's okay if they don't :
    - _You (the instructor) should pick an animal (or other neutral and harmless concept), and progressively build up a codecollab website with the concepts in the tutorial, so that they can see the general flow of building a project._
    - Go to the landing page of HTMLDog's HTML tutorial: https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/.
    - In a new tab, open the [Tags, Attributes and Elements](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/tags/) section.
    - Go through that section, asking students to use the elements presented there to add stuff to their projects related to the idea they have.
    - Do the same for the [Page Titles](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/titles/) and [Paragraph](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/paragraphs/) lessons, but leave enough time to get people into images.
    - Open the [Images](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/images/) section, and run through it.
        - It's particularly useful for folks to go through this section, as it tends to be the one that gets students the most excited.
- [5min] Teach them to download the codecollab and open it in their computers.
    - Codecollab deletes workspaces after 16 days, so we want to make sure they have some persistence.
- [10min] Next steps:
    - Teach them how to google for concepts they don't understand, this could even be "how to insert a link".
    - Give them some ideas as to what they could add next: Links? Lists? Background colors?
    - If there is extra time, it's good to let them experiment a little bit.
