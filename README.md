# Welcome to Inclusive Tech Coding Kickstart!

Here you'll find resources to get you started building interesting projects and exploring the great world of coding.

## Bringing projects to life

Think of something that is exciting to you, something you want to share things about.
It can be anything from your favourite sport to your favourite dishes. The cutest animals, or the most mysterious creatures deep in the sea. Books, movies, games...

You have things to share, and you can do that with your very own webpage!
Here are the things you'll need.

### Your toolbox

- **Learning**: [htmldog.com](https://htmldog.com/) is a great place to start, with friendly tutorials full of examples! We recommend starting with the [HTML Tutorial](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/gettingstarted/). When you're ready to learn more, head over to the [examples](https://htmldog.com/examples/) section for guides on how to achieve specific effects.

- **Creating**: Use [CodeCollab](https://codecollab.io) to share your project with your friends. No registration required!

## Continuing your journey

### Learning together

Coding is more fun when you do it with other people!

- [codeclub.org](https://codeclub.org/en): Code Club is an organisation that runs free coding clubs for the 9-13 year old across the UK and globally. Code Club is part of [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), a UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world.
