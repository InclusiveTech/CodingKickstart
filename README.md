### References

There is a vast amount of information out there, much more than we can keep in our heads! We use these webpages to learn about specific concepts that we might have forgotten.

- https://google.com: Yep, most of the questions we have have already been answered by someone, and Google is a great place to find it!
- https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp: This is a great hub of knowledge of all things HTML and CSS. A great place to search things in!
