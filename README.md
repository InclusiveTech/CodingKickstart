# Welcome to Inclusive Tech Coding Kickstart!

Here you'll find resources to get you started building interesting projects and exploring the great world of coding.

## Bringing projects to life

- TODO (a brief guide on how to approach a project)

### Your toolbox

- **Learning**: [htmldog.com](https://htmldog.com/) is a great place to start, with friendly tutorials full of examples! We recommend starting with the [HTML Tutorial](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/gettingstarted/). When you're ready to learn more, head over to the [examples](https://htmldog.com/examples/) section for guides on how to achieve specific effects.

- **Creating**: Use [CodeCollab](https://codecollab.io) to share your project with your friends. No registration required!

## Continuing your journey

### Learning together

Coding is more fun when you do it with other people!

- [codeclub.org](https://codeclub.org/en): Code Club is an organisation that runs free coding clubs for the 9-13 year old across the UK and globally. Code Club is part of [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), a UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world.

There is a vast amount of information out there, much more than we can keep in our heads! We use these webpages to learn about specific concepts that we might have forgotten.

- [google.com](https://google.com): Yep, most of the questions we have have already been answered by someone, and Google is a great place to find it!
- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp): This is a great hub of knowledge of all things HTML and CSS. A great place to search things in!
