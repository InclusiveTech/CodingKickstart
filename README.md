# Welcome to Inclusive Tech Coding Kickstart!

Here you'll find resources to get you started building interesting projects and exploring the great world of coding.

## Bringing projects to life

Think of something that is exciting to you, something you want to share things about.
It can be anything from your favourite sport to your favourite dishes. The cutest animals, or the most mysterious creatures deep in the sea. Books, movies, games...

You have things to share, and you can do that with your very own webpage!
Here are the things you'll need.

### Your toolbox

- **Creating**: Use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) to share your project with your friends. No registration required!

- **Learning**: [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is a great place to start, with friendly tutorials full of examples! We recommend starting with the [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). While all of the items in the sidebar are excellent, feel free to focus on the things that you want the most. For instance, you might want to look into [HTML Styles](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp) to give your project a more vibrant look.

## Continuing your journey

### Learning together

Coding is more fun when you do it with other people!

- [codeclub.org](https://codeclub.org/en): Code Club is an organisation that runs free coding clubs for the 9-13 year old across the UK and globally. Code Club is part of [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), a UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world.

### References

There is a vast amount of information out there, much more than we can keep in our heads! We use these webpages to learn about specific concepts that we might have forgotten.

- [google.com](https://google.com): Yep, most of the questions we have have already been answered by someone, and Google is a great place to find it!
- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp): This is a great hub of knowledge of all things HTML and CSS. A great place to search things in!
- [htmldog.com](https://htmldog.com/) is another great place to start learning HTML! We recommend starting with the [HTML Tutorial](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/gettingstarted/). When you're ready to learn more, head over to the [examples](https://htmldog.com/examples/) section for guides on how to achieve specific effects.
- [marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io/html-basics.html): Another tutorial on creating webpages, beautiful but comprehensive.
- [codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development): Amazing interactive tutorials that will show you everything you need to know in a fun way. **Note** that they do **require registration**, so we may want to ask for help to your teacher setting that up.
